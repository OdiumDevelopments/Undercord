## Features and what to expect:
- [x] Form with POST method.
- [x] Responsiveness
- [ ] Constant Updates
- [ ] Webhook Logging
- [x] Changeable Templates (Done by changing it in index.php)

**Instabilities:**
- Without the .htaccess, you need to rewrite all the urls and add .php at end.
- If you want to use .htaccess, just upload it to your main directory.
- The generated.int file will eventually reset itself since i did not write the code in int64.
